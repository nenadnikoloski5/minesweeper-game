# minesweeper-game

Hey there!

This is the first game that I have created. It's good old Minesweeper.

The link is: https://nenadnikoloski5.github.io/minesweeper-game/

Since this "game world" of JS is quite new to me, I had help with this project. I'm not too big on browser games so the main focus on this was just the JS.

Also, the default browser right click is disabled because it would get annoying when you are trying to flag a column.


# If someone upgrades this project with some CSS, that would be amazing.
